HW Math Website

Positive Features:
I like the detect pattern feature
All of the listed values/math is very clear
The visuals of the graph are clear
The copy link is a great added feature as well

Bugs:
Adjusting the ‘a’ value should be adjusting the function, not the bounds
The “Show Geometry” button doesn’t seem to be doing anything
Not sure what the “Collapse” button does either
Dark mode is little wonky
A lot of white text boxes which look jarring
Text in the yellow box blends in

Missing in User Ex
It would be nice if functions other than the core three could be graphed, like 1/(a2 - x2) or something.
Some of the displays right above the graph don’t have as smooth of a style as the other part (mostly font and size)
Explain what the graph shows/does
After suggesting completing the square if the inputted equation is invalid, you could explain how to complete the square
