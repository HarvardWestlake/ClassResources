# Multivariable Integration Visualizer

A framework-free, classroom-ready visualizer for double and triple integrals using Three.js, OrbitControls, and Math.js. Built with plain HTML/CSS/JS and no build step. Works on modern browsers (desktop and tablets).

This README consolidates every prompt/requirement addressed during development, plus practical usage notes for teachers and students.

---

## Quick start

1. Serve the repository folder with a simple local server (required for ES modules):
   - Python: `python3 -m http.server` (then open the printed URL)
   - Node: `npx serve` (or any static file server)
2. Visit:
   - `public/static/math/widgets/3d-integration-visualizer/integration.html`
3. Use the sidebar to pick:
   - Method: ∬ Cartesian, ∬ Polar, ∭ Cylindrical, ∭ Spherical
   - Stock shapes: None, Cone, Sphere, Cylinder, Paraboloid
   - Bounds, Partitions, and Display toggles
4. Click “Render”. Use “Reset camera” to frame current content.

Files:
- `integration.html` – UI and module imports (three.js, OrbitControls, math.js)
- `integration.css` – layout, tokens, and light theme aligned to the style guide
- `integration.js` – scene setup, rendering, Riemann elements, voxels, handlers

---

## Controls (mouse and touch)

- Mouse: Left = rotate, Wheel/Middle = zoom, Right = pan
- Touch: One-finger rotate; Two-finger pinch-zoom + pan
- “Reset camera” frames whatever is visible
- iOS pinch-zoom polyfill is enabled to prevent page zoom stealing gestures

---

## Coordinate system (Z-up)

The world vertical axis is Z, matching the math statement “z = f(x, y)”.

- Ground plane is the x–y plane (z = 0)
- A subtle secondary grid sits slightly below z = 0 to cue negative z-values
- All geometry and helpers use direct mapping (x, y, z)

---

## Methods, Jacobians, and Riemann elements

- ∬ over R (Cartesian)
  - Base area: Δx · Δy
  - Columns: instanced boxes sized (Δx, Δy, |f|), centered at z = ±|f|/2
  - Negative values extend below the plane
  - Jacobian label: `dA = dx dy`

- ∬ over R (Polar)
  - Base area: r · Δr · Δθ
  - Columns: instanced boxes sized (Δr, rΔθ, |f|), rotated by θ about z
  - Jacobian label: `dA = r dr dθ`

- ∭ (Cylindrical)
  - Volume element: r · Δr · Δθ · Δz
  - Voxels: instanced bricks sized (Δr, rΔθ, Δz), rotated by θ about z
  - Clipped to selected stock solid
  - Jacobian label: `dV = r dr dθ dz`

- ∭ (Spherical)
  - Volume element: ρ² sinφ Δρ Δφ Δθ
  - Voxels: instanced bricks sized (Δρ, ρΔφ, ρ sinφ Δθ), oriented by spherical local frame
  - Clipped to selected stock solid
  - Jacobian label: `dV = ρ² sinφ dρ dφ dθ`

The highlighted “dA/dV” wedge in the legend displays one representative element sized/oriented according to the correct Jacobian.

---

## Stock shapes (closed solids)

- Sphere: radius R
- Cylinder: radius R, height H (aligned to Z)
- Right circular cone: base radius R, height H (aligned to Z)
- Paraboloid (capped): generated by lathe + top cap

The stock solid’s exact dimensions come from the current bounds. Riemann voxels are clipped to the selected solid for visual clarity and correctness.

---

## Numerical estimate and check

- The estimate text shows “Approx ∬/∭ … ≈ <value>”
- Click “Check vs exact” (triple modes) to compare against analytic volumes:
  - Sphere: (4/3)πR³
  - Cylinder: πR²H
  - Cone: (1/3)πR²H
- Spherical mode requires full angles (φ 0–180, θ 0–360) for a full sphere
- Relative error improves with higher partitions (subject to performance caps)

---

## Performance and stability

- InstancedMesh is used for columns and voxels (large reductions in draw calls)
- Adaptive striding caps total cells (~3–5k by default) to stabilize FPS
- Materials are reused; groups are cleared and geometries disposed between renders
- The canvas always fills the right pane and resizes smoothly

If the scene renders blank (very degenerate bounds), a fallback surface or plane is added and the camera frames it. Error banners render if libraries fail to load.

---

## Teacher demo checklist

1. Cartesian (z = f(x, y))
   - Set `z = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)` and bounds [-2, 2] × [-2, 2]
   - Toggle “Riemann elements” to show columns; try a negative function to see columns below z=0
2. Polar
   - r ∈ [0, 3], θ ∈ [0, 360]
   - Columns rotate tangentially; wedge shows rΔrΔθ
3. Cylindrical (triple)
   - Choose preset “Cylinder”; set r, θ full and z to a reasonable height
   - Voxels are clipped to the cylinder; click “Check vs exact” and vary partitions
4. Spherical (triple)
   - Set ρ ∈ [0, R], φ 0–180, θ 0–360
   - Voxels sized by ρ² sinφ; use “Check vs exact” (should converge as N increases)
5. Camera
   - Demonstrate rotate, zoom, pan, and “Reset camera” (frames content)

---

## Prompts addressed (consolidated)

- Align widget styles to the site style guide (colors, tokens, spacing, buttons)
- Enable smooth rotate/zoom/pan everywhere; add iOS pinch polyfill
- Make negative z visible; unify axes so Z is vertical (z = f(x, y))
- Verify and fix cylindrical/spherical integrations and orientations
- Make “stock shapes” closed solids; clip voxels to the current solid
- Show Jacobians clearly and update deterministically per method
- Ensure numerical estimates converge with partitions; add “Check vs exact”
- Replace many meshes with InstancedMesh; adaptively stride to cap cells
- Harden resize and rendering; avoid z-fighting and visual fuzz
- Improve error handling and defaults (fallback plane/surface; error banners)

---

## Troubleshooting

- Blank or shifting aspect: ensure you’re serving files via a local server (required for ES module imports in `integration.html`)
- “THREE.js/math.js not loaded”: refresh; verify network; or check console. The page shows inline banners if libraries fail.
- Extremely slow rendering: reduce partitions (N), or uncheck “Riemann elements”
- Visual artifacts near z=0: this is usually z-fighting; try changing camera angle or hiding “Surface/Volume”

---

## Development notes

- Keep everything ES5/ES6 compatible—no bundlers or build steps
- All logic lives in three files in this folder
- Coordinate mapping is single-source-of-truth (Z-up; no ad‑hoc axis swaps remain)
- Performance targets: < 150 draw calls by default; ~3–5k visible cells

# 3D Integration Visualizer — Rendering and Interaction README

This document records every critical issue found, the fixes applied, and how to verify and troubleshoot the 3D Integration Visualizer (`public/static/math/widgets/3d-integration-visualizer/`).

## Goals
- Ensure reliable loading of Three.js + OrbitControls
- Guarantee that the canvas has nonzero size and is interactive
- Make rendering visible in all modes (double/triple; Cartesian/Polar/Cylindrical/Spherical)
- Provide fallbacks, diagnostics, and robust error handling

---

## External Libraries and Load Order

- Three.js (r160) — ESM modules
  - `https://unpkg.com/three@0.160.0/build/three.module.js`
  - `https://unpkg.com/three@0.160.0/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js`
- math.js (11.11.0) — UMD
  - `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjs@11.11.0/lib/browser/math.min.js`

Load order (in `integration.html`):
1) A `<script type="module">` imports THREE ESM and sets `window.THREE`, then waits for `DOMContentLoaded` and appends `integration.js` dynamically.
2) `integration.js` runs after DOM is ready, then calls `init()`.

Rationale:
- Avoids races where `integration.js` runs before THREE or the DOM is ready.
- Keeps a global `window.THREE` for the non-module code in `integration.js`.

---

## DOM and Initialization

- All `document.getElementById(...)` lookups are performed inside `captureElements()` which is invoked first in `init()`. This prevents null references from early evaluation.
- `init()` validates the presence of THREE and math.js, surfaces relevant errors to the UI if missing, and aborts safely.

---

## Canvas Sizing and Layout

Key CSS (`integration.css`):
- `.viewport { position: relative; min-height: 100vh; height: 100vh; width: 100%; }`
- `#canvas3d { position: absolute; inset: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }`
- `#canvas3d canvas { height: 100% !important; width: 100% !important; max-width: none !important; display: block; pointer-events: auto; }`
- `.legend { pointer-events: none; }`
- `.sidebar { position: relative; }` (forces theme toggle to stay in the sidebar, not overlay canvas)

Sizing fallback (`getHostSize()` in `integration.js`):
- If container size is invalid or tiny, falls back to computed window-based dimensions and logs the size to the console.

---

## Interaction and Controls

- OrbitControls enabled with:
  - Rotate (LMB), Dolly (MMB/Scroll), Pan (RMB)
  - Touch: One-finger rotate, two-finger dolly/pan
- `renderer.domElement.style.touchAction = 'none'` ensures gestures reach the canvas
- `installPinchZoomPolyfill()` listens for `gesturestart/gesturechange` (Safari/iOS)
- `contextmenu` prevented on canvas
- Top-right legend is non-interactive (`pointer-events: none`), so it doesn’t block dragging

---

## Scene, Camera, and Visibility

World and utilities:
- Z-up world (`DEFAULT_UP = (0,0,1)`)
- Ambient + directional lights
- AxesHelper (size 4)
- GridHelper on z=0 with improved contrast on light background
- Background color: `#e9edf5` (slightly darker than pure white for contrast)

Visibility boosters:
- Higher default surface opacity (≥ 0.45) and darker edge lines for clear visibility
- Always-visible origin marker (AxesHelper 0.5)
- `ensureSomethingVisible()` adds a fallback XY plane when a render pass produces no objects
- `fitCameraToContent()` falls back to a default bounding box when nothing is present; camera never collapses onto target

---

## Renderers and Hardening

All renderers clear groups and then add content based on toggles:
- Double Cartesian (surface, region rectangle, columns, wedge)
- Double Polar (surface sampled in XY, annular sector region, columns, wedge)
- Triple Cylindrical (optional preset volume mesh, region sector ring, voxels, wedge)
- Triple Spherical (optional preset volume mesh, projected ring region, voxels, wedge)

Hardening applied:
- Guarded DOM elements and input parsing with defaults
- Degenerate bounds detection (e.g., Polar rMin/rMax) produces a default surface
- Wedge thickness clamped for visibility
- Partitions (`nx`, `ny`, `nz`) default to sensible values if parsing fails
- `GridHelper.material` guarded for both array/single-material cases (r160+)
- `renderer.outputColorSpace` / `renderer.outputEncoding` feature-detected

---

## Presets and Defaults

`applyPresetBounds()` sets bounds and equation for convenience. Some z-bounds normalized to be symmetric about 0 for better initial camera fits:
- Cone: `zMin = -1.5, zMax = 1.5`
- Paraboloid: `zMin = -2.5, zMax = 2.5`

---

## Diagnostics and Logging

Console logs that help verify correct setup:
- Elements captured and `canvasHost` presence
- Canvas host size (bounding client rect)
- Renderer size set (and actual canvas pixel size)
- Group sizes after each render: surface/columns/region/wedge
- Explicit error messages when THREE or math.js are missing

To view:
1) Open DevTools Console
2) Reload the page
3) Look for logs:
   - `Elements captured. canvasHost: …`
   - `Canvas host size: { w, h, rect }`
   - `Renderer size set to: w h`
   - `Group sizes → surface: … columns: … region: … wedge: …`

---

## Known Issues / Edge Cases

- Extremely narrow/tiny container sizes can still force a very tight camera fit; `fitCameraToContent()` now lowers the chance of this, but extreme sizes will affect the view.
- If CDN requests fail (offline or blocked), the UI displays helpful error messages in the canvas container, and console logs explain the missing dependency.
- The fallback plane may appear if toggles are off or bounds are degenerate; this is expected to guarantee “something” visible.

---

## Quick Start Test

1) Method: Double Cartesian  
   Equation: `sin(x)*cos(y)`  
   Bounds: x ∈ [-3,3], y ∈ [-3,3]  
   Toggles: Surface/Volume ON, Region ON, Riemann elements ON  
   Click Render

2) Method: Double Polar  
   Bounds: r ∈ [0,3], θ ∈ [0,360]  
   Surface ON  
   Click Render

3) Method: Triple Cylindrical + Cylinder preset  
   Bounds: r ∈ [0,2], z ∈ [-2,2], θ ∈ [0,360]  
   Columns ON (voxels)  
   Click Render

---

## Alternative (Legacy) OrbitControls Approach

If ESM is not desired, you can pin to a UMD-compatible three version:
```html
<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/three@0.152.2/build/three.min.js\"></script>
<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/three@0.152.2/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js\"></script>
```
Note: This was replaced by the ESM approach for future compatibility and reliability.

---

## Change Summary (High Signal)

- Migrated to ESM for Three.js and OrbitControls; ensured DOM readiness before loading `integration.js`
- Moved DOM capture into `captureElements()`; added null/NaN guards across renderers
- Fixed canvas sizing and guaranteed non-zero viewport height in grid layout
- Improved color management detection and grid material handling (r160)
- Increased visibility (background, grid contrast, surface opacity, edge color)
- Added origin marker, camera fit fallback, and “ensureSomethingVisible()” plane
- Hardened polar/triple renderers against degenerate bounds; safe defaults for partitions
- Added rich console diagnostics and user-facing error messages

---

## File Map

- `integration.html`: Library includes; ESM bridge; DOM scripts
- `integration.css`: Layout (grid + viewport), canvas sizing, non-interactive legend, theme toggle scope
- `integration.js`: Entire visualization pipeline: init, THREE setup, renderers, fallbacks, diagnostics
- `theme.js`: Light/dark theme toggle and cookie/localStorage integration
- `firebase-config.js`: Optional stub (no-op unless configured)

--- 

If you run into any “blank viewport” scenario, open DevTools Console and read the logs. In nearly all cases, the logs will point directly to the root cause (sizing, dependency, degenerate bounds, or an unexpected CDN/network failure).

# 3D Integration Visualizer - Debugging Guide

## Overview
This document outlines all issues found in the 3D Integration Visualizer that prevent rendering and provides fixes for each.

---

## Critical Issues (Prevent Rendering)

### 1. **Fragile THREE.js Module Loading Pattern**

**Issue:** The current bootstrap pattern uses a two-step process:
1. HTML loads THREE.js as ES modules and assigns to `window.THREE`
2. HTML dynamically injects `integration.js` as a separate script
3. Race condition can occur where `integration.js` runs before THREE is ready

**Location:** `integration.html` lines 224-243

**Current Code:**
```html
<script type="module">
    import * as THREE_MOD from 'https://unpkg.com/three@0.160.0/build/three.module.js';
    import { OrbitControls as OrbitControlsMod } from 'https://unpkg.com/three@0.160.0/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js';
    window.THREE = THREE_MOD;
    window.THREE.OrbitControls = OrbitControlsMod;
    
    // Load integration.js only after THREE is ready AND DOM is ready
    function loadIntegration() {
        const script = document.createElement('script');
        script.src = 'integration.js';
        document.body.appendChild(script);
    }
    
    if (document.readyState === 'loading') {
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', loadIntegration);
    } else {
        loadIntegration();
    }
</script>
```

**Problem:** The dynamically injected script can execute before modules are fully resolved, causing the guard in `setupThree()` to fail:

```javascript
// integration.js line 69-72
if (!window.THREE || !THREE.WebGLRenderer) {
    console.error('THREE.js not ready in setupThree()');
    return; // EXIT EARLY - Nothing renders!
}
```

**Fix:** Convert `integration.js` to a module and import it directly:

```html
<script type="module">
import * as THREE from 'https://unpkg.com/three@0.160.0/build/three.module.js';
import { OrbitControls } from 'https://unpkg.com/three@0.160.0/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js';

window.THREE = THREE;
window.THREE.OrbitControls = OrbitControls;

// Import the viewer module directly - guaranteed to run after THREE is ready
import './integration.js';
</script>
```

**Alternative Fix (if keeping integration.js as IIFE):** Add explicit ready check:

```html
<script type="module">
    import * as THREE from 'https://unpkg.com/three@0.160.0/build/three.module.js';
    import { OrbitControls } from 'https://unpkg.com/three@0.160.0/examples/jsm/controls/OrbitControls.js';
    
    window.THREE = THREE;
    window.THREE.OrbitControls = OrbitControls;
    
    // Force integration.js to wait
    window.THREE_READY = true;
    
    const script = document.createElement('script');
    script.src = 'integration.js';
    document.body.appendChild(script);
</script>
```

Then add check in `integration.js`:
```javascript
function setupThree() {
    // Wait for THREE to be ready
    if (!window.THREE_READY || !window.THREE || !THREE.WebGLRenderer) {
        console.error('THREE.js not ready in setupThree()');
        setTimeout(setupThree, 50); // Retry
        return;
    }
    // ... rest of setup
}
```

---

### 2. **CORS/File Protocol Issues**

**Issue:** ES module imports from CDN fail when page is opened via `file://` protocol or in restrictive environments.

**Symptoms:**
- Console shows CORS errors
- `window.THREE` is `undefined`
- Blank canvas with "THREE.js not ready" error

**Fix:** Always serve via HTTP:
```bash
# Option 1: Python simple server
cd public/static/math/widgets/3d-integration-visualizer
python -m http.server 8000

# Option 2: Node http-server
npx http-server -p 8000

# Option 3: Vite dev server (from project root)
npm run dev

# Then open: http://localhost:8000/integration.html
```

---

### 3. **Canvas Container Size Issues**

**Issue:** The `#canvas3d` container can report 0×0 dimensions before CSS layout completes, causing WebGL initialization to fail or create an invalid canvas.

**Location:** `integration.js` lines 47-65

**Current Code:**
```javascript
function getHostSize() {
    if (!canvasHost) {
        console.error('canvasHost is null! Using fallback dimensions.');
        return { w: 800, h: 600 };
    }
    const rect = canvasHost.getBoundingClientRect();
    let w = Math.max(1, Math.floor(rect.width || canvasHost.clientWidth || 1));
    let h = Math.max(1, Math.floor(rect.height || canvasHost.clientHeight || 1));
    // Fallback when container is collapsed or dimensions invalid
    if (!isFinite(w) || !isFinite(h) || w < 50 || h < 50) {
        // Fallback if layout hasn't sized yet
        w = Math.max(300, window.innerWidth - 380);
        h = Math.max(300, window.innerHeight - 24);
    }
    // ...
}
```

**Problem:** Even with fallback, if window is resized or constrained, dimensions can be invalid.

**Fix:** Add explicit size enforcement in CSS:

```css
/* integration.css */
#canvas3d {
    position: absolute;
    inset: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    min-width: 300px;  /* ADD THIS */
    min-height: 300px; /* ADD THIS */
}
```

**Additional Fix:** Force a re-measure after canvas attachment:

```javascript
// integration.js line 88-89 (after appendChild)
canvasHost.appendChild(renderer.domElement);
renderer.domElement.style.touchAction = 'none';

// ADD: Force immediate layout and re-measure
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
    const { w, h } = getHostSize();
    if (w > 50 && h > 50 && (w !== renderer.domElement.width || h !== renderer.domElement.height)) {
        renderer.setSize(w, h);
        camera.aspect = w / h;
        camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
    }
});
```

---

## UI/CSS Issues (Don't Block Rendering)

### 4. **Incorrect Button Class Names**

**Issue:** Buttons use BEM notation (`btn--outline`, `btn--sm`) but CSS defines kebab-case (`btn-outline`, `btn-sm`).

**Locations:**
- `integration.html` line 200: `class="btn btn--outline"`
- `integration.html` line 207: `class="btn btn--outline btn--sm"`

**CSS Definitions:**
- `shared/styles.css` line 287: `.btn-outline`
- `shared/styles.css` line 307: `.btn-sm`

**Fix:**
```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<button id="resetCameraBtn" class="btn btn--outline">Reset camera</button>
<button id="compareBtn" class="btn btn--outline btn--sm" type="button">Check vs exact</button>

<!-- AFTER -->
<button id="resetCameraBtn" class="btn btn-outline">Reset camera</button>
<button id="compareBtn" class="btn btn-outline btn-sm" type="button">Check vs exact</button>
```

---

## Minor Issues & Improvements

### 5. **Unused Variable**

**Location:** `integration.js` line 274

**Issue:**
```javascript
function buildSurfaceFromFunction(expr, x0, x1, y0, y1, nxSamples, nySamples, color, opacity) {
    const geom = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
    const vertices = [];
    const normals = [];  // DECLARED BUT NEVER USED
    const uvs = [];
    // ...
}
```

**Fix:** Remove line 274:
```javascript
const vertices = [];
const uvs = [];
const indices = [];
// normals removed - THREE.js computes them via computeVertexNormals()
```

---

### 6. **Script Tag Location**

**Location:** `integration.html` lines 245-248

**Issue:** Script after `</body>` is valid but unconventional:
```html
</body>
<script>
// Prevent pinch-zoom from interfering with orbit controls on iOS
document.addEventListener('gesturestart', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }, { passive: false });
</script>
</html>
```

**Fix:** Move inside `<body>` before closing tag:
```html
    <script>
    // Prevent pinch-zoom from interfering with orbit controls on iOS
    document.addEventListener('gesturestart', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }, { passive: false });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

---

### 7. **Scene Background Contrast**

**Location:** `integration.js` line 96

**Issue:** Light gray background (`0xf5f5f5`) has low contrast with white/light surfaces.

**Current:**
```javascript
scene.background = new THREE.Color(0xf5f5f5);
```

**Suggested:**
```javascript
scene.background = new THREE.Color(0xe9edf5); // Slightly more blue-tinted for contrast
```

---

### 8. **Polar Shape Path Not Explicitly Closed**

**Location:** `integration.js` lines 380-399

**Issue:** Shape for polar region doesn't call `closePath()`:
```javascript
function addRegionPolar(r0, r1, t0, t1) {
    const shape = new THREE.Shape();
    // ... draw outer arc
    // ... draw inner arc
    // Missing: shape.closePath();
    const geom = new THREE.ShapeGeometry(shape);
    // ...
}
```

**Fix:** Add before `ShapeGeometry` creation:
```javascript
    shape.lineTo(x, y);
}
shape.closePath(); // ADD THIS
const geom = new THREE.ShapeGeometry(shape);
```

## Debugging Checklist

Use this checklist to diagnose rendering issues:

### Step 1: Check Console
- [ ] Open DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
- [ ] Look for errors:
  - [ ] "THREE.js not ready in setupThree()" → Module loading issue (#1)
  - [ ] CORS errors → File protocol issue (#2)
  - [ ] "canvasHost is null" → DOM element missing
  - [ ] "WebGL context lost" → GPU/driver issue

### Step 2: Verify THREE.js Loaded
In console, type:
```javascript
console.log(window.THREE);
console.log(THREE.WebGLRenderer);
```
- If `undefined`, module loading failed (#1, #2)

### Step 3: Check Canvas Element
In console, type:
```javascript
console.log(document.querySelector('#canvas3d canvas'));
```
- If `null`, renderer never attached (#1, #3)
- If exists but tiny (check `.width`, `.height`), size issue (#3)

### Step 4: Check Element Sizes
In console, type:
```javascript
const host = document.getElementById('canvas3d');
console.log(host.getBoundingClientRect());
```
- Width/height should be > 100px
- If near zero, CSS layout issue (#3)

### Step 5: Force Render
In console, type:
```javascript
// Assuming init() has run:
render();
ensureSomethingVisible();
fitCameraToContent();
```
- Should show content
- If still blank, check that groups have children

### Step 6: Check Scene Contents
In console, type:
```javascript
console.log('Surface:', surfaceGroup?.children.length);
console.log('Columns:', columnsGroup?.children.length);
console.log('Region:', regionGroup?.children.length);
console.log('Wedge:', wedgeGroup?.children.length);
```
- At least one should be > 0
- If all zero, render logic issue

## Implementation Priority

### Must Fix (Critical)
1. **Module Loading Pattern** (#1) - Most likely cause
2. **Serve via HTTP** (#2) - Required for modules
3. **Canvas Size** (#3) - Can cause blank/broken canvas

### Should Fix (UI Polish)
4. **Button Classes** (#4) - Visible style bugs

### Nice to Have (Code Quality)
5. Unused variable (#5)
6. Script location (#6)
7. Scene background (#7)
8. Shape path (#8)
