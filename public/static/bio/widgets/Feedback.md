With no knowledge about DNA, I had no idea what I was pressing (and didn’t realize that it was a quiz and just thought that the buttons were out of order). Also if you randomly spam click the next option while the animation for the past one was running, it will break as they go at the same time and don’t properly remove some of the elements.

I like how there is a “reset” button. 
I’m not well versed in Biology so mybe you could expand out what DNA Pol stands for. Like, what is “Pol”? Also maybe you could have glossary below that explains what the following words are: Primase, Topoisomerase, Ligase, Seals Nicks. Also maybe you could edit the line “Click the enzymes in the correct order!” to say “Click the enzymes in the correct order! See how Prokaryotic DNA Replicationn happens!”.
