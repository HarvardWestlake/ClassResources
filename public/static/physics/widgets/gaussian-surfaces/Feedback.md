GAUSSIAN SURFACE NOTES:

It took a second to find the controls for changing the variables, as you have to scroll a bit past the 3D rendering itself.
The graph is very self-explanatory, though, and I like how the circle moves when you change the sliders.
You could maybe consider to put 1 3D render/graph "above the fold" at the top of the page to give the user a teaser of what they will be doing before scrolling through all the math.
The style is consistent with the rest of the website and hw.com -- looks good.
The sphere rendering looks a bit squished, maybe this is perspective? This also seems to happen in the other renderings, too, it's just less obvious.
You could maybe explain the bit about the cyan pillbox being the Gaussian surface in the plane section instead of the "Key Observations" section.

small visual bug; displaying e field on 2 planes shows an arrow which points through a plane
cant change observation point on two planes
