Programming Widget Notes

 

CJ

Really awesome 3d graphics
Would love to see more information of what (number?) the E is (whatever that is)
 

Joya

Really like the 3D Galvanic cell image
Maybe implement one line of directions and say what you should expect to see with the model
The “Click and Drag to Rotate” line should be more near the top so it’s easier to use
 

Hannah

Click and drag to rotate note should be on top rather than bottom
3d image with 360 view is super cool
I lowkey have no idea what’s going on but that’s prob bc I didn’t take honors chem
The electrode couple selector is super simple and easy to use I like it
