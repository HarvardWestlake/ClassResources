Dawson’s Websites Notes

Daniel 
- I liked how it takes an economic term and then makes it into a simple real world example
- One thing that was unintuitive to me was I did not know what implicit costs, account profit, explicit cost, or total profit were. These are terms maybe familiar only to an economist and not to a regular user
- I also don’t have that much knowledge about Pokemon and so I didn’t know whether certain cards were good or bad. I don’t think this is essential knowledge though

Ryan
- I like the step-by-step walk through of economics using a fun and interactive example that can engage the user.
- Some people who don’t know anything about pokemon or even dislike it might find it hard to relate and stay engaged though.
- Some users may wish for exact and detailed definitions for terms like implicit cost, explicit cost, etc.
