Notes on Latin widget website: 

Hannah 

- I like the instructions but they're lowkey wordy so i didn't read them at all bc tldr
	- maybe bold some more stuff so that the user's eyes can focus on stuff and it isn't word salad
- it does some incorrect translations
- there's no reset button; you have to refresh the page
- good that the interface is simple and very step by step
- pretty much endless options

Lauren
- maybe put in an example to show how its supposed to work bc i have no latin knowledge and am kinda confused bc i dont know if its working or not
- also note that what Hannah said you dont have to refresh but you do have to try to translate it yourself first so maybe make it so that you can edit it?
