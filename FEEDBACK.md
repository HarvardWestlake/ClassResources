Having the types of bonds is cool
3d render of molecular structure is also cool
Initially figuring out how to use the settings is difficult, maybe add a pointer to it when the page is loaded
Maybe make the 3 cards for the current state, particle visual, and graph equal sizes
Or maybe make the settings checkboxes
