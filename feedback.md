Miles: 

Unclear what about electricc field I am being shown

Dragging a ball to the corner makes everything smaller (FIXED)

I thought paint + and - meant zoom not charge (FIXED)

Audrey:

You can zoom out but not in, making big things makes the whole screen zoom out and starts getting laggy (FIXED)

Instructions for the buttons feel far away from actual buttons and potentially won't be noticed first?

Simulation worked despite the horrors I attempted to inflict on it!
