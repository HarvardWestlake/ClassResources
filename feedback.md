MAX:
UI elements are good but not in HW Style
Features are all straightforward to use but maybe hardness chart should be in a different section to separate inspection, tests, and charts
Adding notes are cool
Tips at the bottom are helpful, but consider expanding to a more comprehensive notebook about the properties of each element
Observations sheet and progression is easy to use and straightforward
Maybe consider making the "New mineral received. Begin your tests" a popup instead of a card at the top of the observations

CHASE:
I'm not familiar with the cleavage planes and luster of different stones -- maybe you could add charts, similar to the hardness chart, for those properties. There are a few tips on the bottom of the screen, but it would be helpful to have a whole chart.
A small guide in the beginning could be helpful -- it took a minute to get my bearings.
I like the luster rendering and the hardness chart.
The observation list is a nice way to keep all information visible at once.
