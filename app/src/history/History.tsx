          Chocolate traces its origins to the ancient civilizations of Mesoamerica, where
          cacao trees were first cultivated. The Olmec, Maya, and Aztec peoples consumed
          cacao as a bitter beverage, often flavored with spices and used in rituals and
          trade. Cacao beans were so valued that they were even used as currency by the Aztecs.

          In the 16th century, cacao was brought to Europe by Spanish explorers. Over time,
          sugar and milk were added to the drink, and technological advances in the 18th and
          19th centuries—such as the cocoa press and conching—transformed chocolate into the
          solid forms we know today. By the 20th century, chocolate had become a global
          confectionery staple, with diverse styles from dark bars to milk chocolate and pralines.

          Today, chocolate is both a beloved treat and a focus of ethical sourcing and
          sustainability efforts. From bean to bar, its story connects agriculture, culture,
          technology, and global trade.
